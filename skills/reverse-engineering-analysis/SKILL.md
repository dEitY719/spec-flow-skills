# spec-flow:reverse-engineering-analysis

## Purpose

You are a **Feature Analysis Specialist**. Your goal is to:

1. Deeply understand how a specific feature is implemented in the current codebase
2. Identify the essential libraries and their roles
3. Explain the working mechanism (data flow focus)
4. **Generate a copy-pasteable AI implementation prompt** — the most important output

The final deliverable lets the user paste one prompt into any AI coding assistant to implement the same feature in a new project.

---

## Input

```
/spec-flow:reverse-engineering-analysis "<feature or file path>" [output directory]
```

**Examples:**
```
/spec-flow:reverse-engineering-analysis "frontend의 graph 기능" docs/feature/frontend-graph/
/spec-flow:reverse-engineering-analysis "backend의 알람메일발송 기능" docs/feature/backend-email/
/spec-flow:reverse-engineering-analysis .github/workflows/ci.yml docs/feature/workflows-ci/
```

- **Feature description** — search codebase with Grep/Glob to find relevant files
- **File path** — read and analyze directly
- Output: `<output_dir>/analysis.md` (default dir: `docs/`)

---

## Help

If the argument is `-h`, `--help`, or `help`, read `references/help.md` and output its content verbatim, then stop.

## Options

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `<feature or file path>` | yes | — | Feature description (keyword search) or explicit file path |
| `[output directory]` | no | `docs/` | Directory where `analysis.md` is written |

> **Pattern**: All skills should place help content (usage, arguments, examples) in
> `references/help.md` and use a one-line pointer here. This keeps SKILL.md under
> the 100-line limit while making help always reachable.

## Analysis Workflow

See [`references/workflow.md`](references/workflow.md) for full step details.

Stop on error: if any step fails, abort and report the failed step.

**Step 1: Locate** — search by keyword or read file path directly
**Step 2: Deep Dive** — scan imports/exports first on large files; read body only if needed
**Step 3: Extract Libraries** — gather from imports; check package manifest once for versions
**Step 4: Explain Mechanism** — data flow, component handoffs, non-obvious design choices
**Step 5: Generate AI Prompt** — self-contained and paste-and-go (**most critical output**)

---

## Output Format

Write to `<output_dir>/analysis.md`. See [`references/output-template.md`](references/output-template.md) for the full template.

Required sections:
- **Overview** — 1-2 sentence summary
- **Key Libraries** — table: Library / Version / Role
- **How It Works** — data flow and key abstractions
- **File Map** — source files with roles
- **AI Implementation Prompt** — copy-pasteable, no project-specific paths

End with `[OK] analysis written: <path>` or `[FAIL] <reason>`. A pre-write
quality checklist is in `references/output-template.md`.

`Next: read <output_dir>/analysis.md and paste the AI Implementation Prompt section into the target project's AI assistant.`
